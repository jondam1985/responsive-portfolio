                Hi, my name is Damian and, I’m sorry to disappoint you but, I’m
                not the shark in that picture. I’m the guy below the shark. With that out of the way here is
                a little bit about me. I’m a web developer (a regular web developer, not a shark web developer.
                Sorry again) who specializes in building beautiful and functional websites using HTML, CSS and
                JavaScript. My background was originally in Engineering and Finance, but I decided to make I
                change when I moved to Canada, and here I am now, developing websites and loving it.

            <p class="about-me">
                I would like to share a story my grandma used to tell me as a kid and that greatly shaped who
                I am now. For some reason she told me this story in Latin, which is weird because she only spoke
                Spanish. But anyway, the story goes something like this: “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
                adipiscing elit. Nulla ac neque ex. Sed ut ex id elit faucibus commodo. Sed porttitor nec metus nec
                rhoncus. Nunc ut nibh tortor. Proin condimentum commodo nisi, vel convallis purus pretium et. Etiam
                et porta erat. Duis lacinia, lorem et lobortis vehicula, elit purus eleifend felis, sit amet finibus
                est purus eu ante”. Beautiful right?
